This should be an inspectably impact-free change, at the cost of readability;
that is, a reviewer should be able to tell easiliy from each commit that, when
cca_use_bare_configs is false, the behavior does not change.

When the cca_use_bare_configs setting is true:

* AD no longer sends service configs (FIXME's)

* [DONE] AD logs scheduler does not send services

* [DONE] AD logs scheduler recognizes these and creates sources if CCA enabled

  * This requires ContainerOrPods to determine how to generate Service and
    Source properties

* [DONE] CCA scheduler disabled

* [DONE] k8s launcher disabled

* [DONE] Docker launcher only pairs sources with services if feature flag is false

* Docker launcher recognizes kcur, dcur, force_dcur, path accessibility,
  LogWhat, and registry in deciding whether to log a container from socket or file
    * let's put this byzantine logic in a new module
